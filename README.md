# Dialga
## A fan-made Pokemon themed Wear OS watch face

### Installation

1. Build from source

2. Enable Developer Options on your wearable device by going into your device "about" section in your settings. Tap the OS version number seven times. A toast message will appear confirming developer options enabled.

3. Connect to your device using adb with either the usb charging cable, or by using adb over network.

4. Install using `adb install [/PATH/TO/APK]` without square brackets.

5. Use the WearOS app on your phone to change the current watch face to Dialga if it did not change automatically.

### Uninstall

Use `adb uninstall xyz.apricorn.sora.dialga`

Alternatively, you can use android studio to install the app. Just build, and choose your adb connected device, or a virtual device when you run.
